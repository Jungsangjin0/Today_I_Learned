# 엔티티 직접 사용

- JQPL에서 엔티티를 직접 사용하면 SQL에서 해당 엔티티의 기본 키 값을 사용

```java

select count(m.id) from Member m // entityId
select count(m) from Member m //entity

////////////////////////////////////////////////

select count(m.id) as cnt from Member m
```

```java

select m from Member m where m = :member
setParameter("member", member)

select m from Member m where m.id = :memberId

```

### 외래 키 값
```java

select m from Member m where m.team = :team
select m from Member m wherer m.team.id = :teamId;

select m.* from Member m where m.team_id = ?
```
